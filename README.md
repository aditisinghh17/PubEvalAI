# Developing a Evaluation Framework for Conversational AI in Public Procurement: Enhancing Decision-Making in AI Product Selection
  
  
 ## Understanding Public Procurement
 Public procurement is the process by which government agencies acquire goods, services, or works from private suppliers through a structured method of needs assessment, bidding, evaluation, and contract award.

 Procurement of conversational AI solutions can present several challenges: 
 1. Cost Management: The total cost of ownership can be difficult to estimate, with hidden costs potentially arising.
 2. Scalability: Handling multiple simultaneous interactions efficiently is crucial for maintaining performance during peak usage times.
 3. Perfromance meaurement:  Measuring the performance and of conversational AI solutions can be difficult.
 4. Data Privacy and Security Concerns: Ensuring compliance with data protection regulations and securing sensitive information is critical.

# To deal with this problem we introduce PubEvalAI 
Evaluation Metrics: The framework focuses on key metrics like cost per query, concurrency, and latency to assess Conversational AI solutions, ensuring they meet the performance requirements for public procurement.

“MU” Metric:  A novel "MU" metric is introduced to evaluate the effectiveness of AI systems in filtering out spam and irrelevant queries, particularly those that attempt to bypass topical guardrails, prompt leaking, and jailbreaking.

Future Expansion: The framework is designed to be adaptable, with plans to introduce additional metrics as the research progresses, allowing for a comprehensive evaluation of Conversational AI products.
